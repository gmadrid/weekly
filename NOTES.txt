Need to:
- start by defining a new layout
  - "cards"
    - title
    - card areas with subtitle line and gray lines for tasks
      - maybe a dot to left of line
- also use remarkable dimensions
- also use PNG output



Size of page.
Size of margins - defines outer box.

Specify size of top labels - top box rest is "bottom box"

bottom box is divided into N columns + 1 for the labels
bottom box is divided into DAYS rows - one for each day in the month






- want to create a grid in a certain sized box with labels.
- also put some titles and legends on it.
- should automatically take a month and make enough rows for that
- maybe diagonal headers
- OPT: styling alternate rows
- OPT: styling lines

- make coordinate system
- draw arbitrary lines
- draw rectangles
- OPT: only draw shared lines once (in grid is easier)
- use PDF/SVG as output mechanism, but don't require that
- then print via browser?
